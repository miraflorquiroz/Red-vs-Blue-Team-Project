# Red-vs-Blue-Team-Project
Capstone Engagement ( Assessment, Analysis,  and Hardening of a Vulnerable System)

Red Team vs. Blue Team activity where we attacked a machine and then analyze the log results of that attack. Specifically, I have examine both of my own logs as well as the logs of one of my team. 


Red Team: Our Team attacked a vulnerable VM within our environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine.
Blue Team: Used Kibana to review logs taken during the Day 1 engagement, and use them to extract hard data and visualizations for the report.
